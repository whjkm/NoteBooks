# Data Wrangling

`sed`: "stram editor"
       `s`: substitution
        The`s` command is written on the form: `s/REGEX/SUBSTITUTION/`, where `REGEX` is the regular expression you want to search for, and `SUBSTITUTION` is the text you want to substitute matching text with.

## Regular expressions

Regular expressions are usually(though not always) surrounded by `/`.
- `.` means "any single character" except newline.
- `*` zero or more of the preceding match.
- `+` one or more of the preceding match.
- `[abc]` any one character of `a`, `b`, `c`.
- `(RX1|RX2)` either something that matches `RX1` or `RX2`.
- `^` the start of the line.
- `$` the end of the line.

## awk
`awk` is a programming language that just happens to be really good at processing text streams.

`awk` programs take the form of an optional pattern plus a block saying what to do if the pattern matches a given line.

`$0` is set to the entire line's contents, and `$1` through `$n` are set to the `n`th field of that line, when separated by the `awk` field separator (whitespace by default, change with `-F`).

```
| awk '$1 == 1 && $2 ~ /^c[^ ]*e$/ { print $2}' | wc -l
```

```
BEGIN { row = 0 }
$1 == 1 && $2 ~ /^c[^ ]*e$/ { rows += $1}
END { print rows }
```
