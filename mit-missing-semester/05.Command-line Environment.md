# Command-line Environment

## Job Control

### killing a process
Your shell is using a UNIX communication mechanism called a *signal* to communicate information to the process. signals are software interrupts.

example for captures `SIGINT` and ignores it.
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import signal, time

def handler(signum, time):
    print("\nI got a SIGINT, but I am not stopping")

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, handler)
i = 0
while True:
    time.sleep(.1)
    print("\r{}".format(i), end="")
    i += 1
```

a more generic signal for asking a process to exit gracefully is the `SIGTERM` signal. 
```
kill -TERM <PID>
```

### Pausing and backgrounding processes
Signals can do other things beyond killing a process. 
`SIGSTOP` pauses a process. 

```
Ctrl-C    SIGINT
Ctrl-\    SIGQUIT
Ctrl-Z    SIGTSTP (i.e. the terminalâ€™s version of SIGSTOP)
```

`fg` continue the paused job in the foreground
`bg` continue the paused job in the background,To background an already running program you can do `Ctrl-Z` followed by `bg`. backgrounded processes are still children processes of your terminal and will die if you close the terminal.

the`&`suffix in a command will run the command in the background

`nohup` (a wrapper to ignore SIGHUP)

## Terminal Multiplexers

### tmux

`tmux` allow you to multiplex terminal windows using panes and tabs so you can interact with multiple shell sessions. `tmux` is highly configurable and by using the associated keybindings you can create multiple tabs and panes and quickly navigate through them.

`tmux` expects you to know its keybindings, and they all have the form `<C-b> x `where that means
 (1) press `Ctrl+b`, 
 (2) release `Ctrl+b`, and then
 (3) press `x`. 
`tmux` has the following hierarchy of objects:

- Sessions: a session is an independent workspace with one or more windows.
  - `tmux` start a new session.
  - `tmux new -s NAME` starts it with that name.
  - `tmux ls` lists the current sessions.
  - Within `tmux` typing `<C-b> d ` detaches current session.
  - `tmux a` attaches the last session, you can use `-t` flag to specify which.
  
- Windows: Equivalant to tabs in editors or browsers, they are visually separate parts of the same session.
  - `<C-b> c ` creates a new windows, To close it you can just terminate the shells doing `<C-d>`
