# Shell Tools and Scripting

## Shell Scripting
### Special variables

``` shell
$0 - Name of the script

$1 to $9 - Arguments to the script. $1 is the first argument and so on.

$@ - All the arguments

$# - Number of arguments

$? - Return code of the previous command

$$ - Process identification number (PID) for the current script

!! - Entire last command, including arguments. A common pattern is to execute a command only for it to fail due to missing permissions; you can quickly re-execute the command with sudo by doing sudo !!

$_ - Last argument from the last command. If you are in an interactive shell, you can also quickly get this value by typing Esc followed by . or Alt+.
```

### Shell globbing

- **Wildcards**: you can use `?` and `*` to match one or any amount of characters respectively.
- **Curly braces** `{}`: 
  ``` shell
  mv *{.py,.sh} folder
  # Will move all *.py and *.sh files

  mkdir foo bar
  # This creates files foo/a, foo/b, ... foo/h, bar/a, bar/b, ... bar/h
  touch {foo,bar}/{a..h}
  touch foo/x bar/y
  ```

### Shebang line

It is good practice to write shebang lines using the `env` command that will resolve to wherever the command lives in the system.

``` shell
#!/bin/bash
#!/usr/local/bin/python
#!/usr/bin/env python
```

## Shell Tools 

### Manuals

  - [TLDR pages](https://tldr.sh/): a community effort to simplify the beloved man pages with practical examples.
  - [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck): will help you find errors in your sh/bash scripts.

### find files
  - `find`: some `find` examples.
  ```shell
  # Find all directories named src
  find . -name src -type d
  # Find all python files that have a folder named test in their path
  find . -path '*/test/*.py' -type f
  # Find all files modified in the last day
  find . -mtime -1
  # Find all zip files with size in range 500k to 10M
  find . -size +500k -size -10M -name '*.tar.gz'

  # Delete all files with .tmp extension
  find . -name '*.tmp' -exec rm {} \;
  # Find all PNG files and convert them to JPG
  find . -name '*.png' -exec convert {} {}.jpg \;
  ```
  - [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd): is a simple, fast, and user-friendly alternative to `find`.
  - `locate`:

### find codes

  - `grep`:
  - [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep): `rg`, 
  ```shell
  # Find all python files where I used the requests library
  rg -t py 'import requests'
  # Find all files (including hidden files) without a shebang line
  rg -u --files-without-match "^#!"
  # Find all matches of foo and print the following 5 lines
  rg foo -A 5
  # Print statistics of matches (# of matched lines and files )
  rg --stats PATTERN
  ```
  - [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher): `ag`

### find shell commands

  - `history`:
  - `Ctrl+R`: to perform backwards search through your history.
  - [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): `fzf` is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.
  - add `HISTCONTROL=ignorespace` to your `.bashrc`: preventing commands with a leading space from being included. 

### Directory Navigation
  - [`fasd`](https://github.com/clvv/fasd):Fasd ranks files and directories by [frecency algorithm](https://web.archive.org/web/20210421120120/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Places/Frecency_algorithm), that is, by both frequency and recency. 
  - [`autojump`](https://github.com/wting/autojump):
  - `tree`:
  - [`broot`](https://github.com/Canop/broot):
  - [`nnn`](https://github.com/jarun/nnn): full-featured terminal file manager.
  - [`ranger`](https://github.com/ranger/ranger):is a console file manager
