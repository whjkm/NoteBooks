# Shell Tools and Scripting

## Shell Scripting
### Special variables

``` shell
$0 - Name of the script

$1 to $9 - Arguments to the script. $1 is the first argument and so on.

$@ - All the arguments

$# - Number of arguments

$? - Return code of the previous command

$$ - Process identification number (PID) for the current script

!! - Entire last command, including arguments. A common pattern is to execute a command only for it to fail due to missing permissions; you can quickly re-execute the command with sudo by doing sudo !!

$_ - Last argument from the last command. If you are in an interactive shell, you can also quickly get this value by typing Esc followed by . or Alt+.
```

### Shell globbing

- **Wildcards**: you can use `?` and `*` to match one or any amount of characters respectively.
- **Curly braces** `{}`: 
  ``` shell
  mv *{.py,.sh} folder
  # Will move all *.py and *.sh files

  mkdir foo bar
  # This creates files foo/a, foo/b, ... foo/h, bar/a, bar/b, ... bar/h
  touch {foo,bar}/{a..h}
  touch foo/x bar/y
  ```

### Shebang line

It is good practice to write shebang lines using the `env` command that will resolve to wherever the command lives in the system.

``` shell
#!/bin/bash
#!/usr/local/bin/python
#!/usr/bin/env python
```
