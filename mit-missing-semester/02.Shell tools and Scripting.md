# Shell Tools and Scripting

## Shell Scripting
### Special variables

``` shell
$0 - Name of the script

$1 to $9 - Arguments to the script. $1 is the first argument and so on.

$@ - All the arguments

$# - Number of arguments

$? - Return code of the previous command

$$ - Process identification number (PID) for the current script

!! - Entire last command, including arguments. A common pattern is to execute a command only for it to fail due to missing permissions; you can quickly re-execute the command with sudo by doing sudo !!

$_ - Last argument from the last command. If you are in an interactive shell, you can also quickly get this value by typing Esc followed by . or Alt+.
```

### Shell globbing

- **Wildcards**: you can use `?` and `*` to match one or any amount of characters respectively.
- **Curly braces** `{}`: 
  ``` shell
  mv *{.py,.sh} folder
  # Will move all *.py and *.sh files

  mkdir foo bar
  # This creates files foo/a, foo/b, ... foo/h, bar/a, bar/b, ... bar/h
  touch {foo,bar}/{a..h}
  touch foo/x bar/y
  ```

### Shebang line

It is good practice to write shebang lines using the `env` command that will resolve to wherever the command lives in the system.

``` shell
#!/bin/bash
#!/usr/local/bin/python
#!/usr/bin/env python
```

## Shell Tools 

### Manuals

  - [TLDR pages](https://tldr.sh/): a community effort to simplify the beloved man pages with practical examples.
  - [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck): will help you find errors in your sh/bash scripts.

### find files
  - `find`: some `find` examples.
  ```shell
  # Find all directories named src
  find . -name src -type d
  # Find all python files that have a folder named test in their path
  find . -path '*/test/*.py' -type f
  # Find all files modified in the last day
  find . -mtime -1
  # Find all zip files with size in range 500k to 10M
  find . -size +500k -size -10M -name '*.tar.gz'

  # Delete all files with .tmp extension
  find . -name '*.tmp' -exec rm {} \;
  # Find all PNG files and convert them to JPG
  find . -name '*.png' -exec convert {} {}.jpg \;
  ```
  - [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd): is a simple, fast, and user-friendly alternative to `find`.
  - `locate`:

### find codes

  - `grep`:
  - [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep): `rg`, 
  ```shell
  # Find all python files where I used the requests library
  rg -t py 'import requests'
  # Find all files (including hidden files) without a shebang line
  rg -u --files-without-match "^#!"
  # Find all matches of foo and print the following 5 lines
  rg foo -A 5
  # Print statistics of matches (# of matched lines and files )
  rg --stats PATTERN
  ```
  - [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher): `ag`

### find shell commands

  - `history`:
  - `Ctrl+R`: to perform backwards search through your history.
  - [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): `fzf` is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.
  - add `HISTCONTROL=ignorespace` to your `.bashrc`: preventing commands with a leading space from being included. 

### Directory Navigation
  - [`fasd`](https://github.com/clvv/fasd):Fasd ranks files and directories by [frecency algorithm](https://web.archive.org/web/20210421120120/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Places/Frecency_algorithm), that is, by both frequency and recency. 
  - [`autojump`](https://github.com/wting/autojump):
  - `tree`:
  - [`broot`](https://github.com/Canop/broot):
  - [`nnn`](https://github.com/jarun/nnn): full-featured terminal file manager.
  - [`ranger`](https://github.com/ranger/ranger):is a console file manager

## Exercises

3. Say you have a command that fails rarely. In order to debug it you need to capture its output but it can be time consuming to get a failure run. Write a bash script that runs the following script until it fails and captures its standard output and error streams to files and prints everything at the end. Bonus points if you can also report how many runs it took for the script to fail.
test3.sh
   ```shell
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   n=$(( RANDOM % 100 ))
   if [[ n -eq 42 ]]; then
    echo "Something went wrong"
    >&2 echo "The error was using magic numbers"
    exit 1
   fi
   echo "Everything went according to plan"
   ```

result
  ```shell
  #!/bin/sh
  i=1;
  while true
  do
        ./test3.sh 2> output.log
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
                echo "failed after $i times"
                cat output.log
                break
        fi
        i=$(($i+1));
  done
  ```

4. As we covered in the lecture find’s -exec can be very powerful for performing operations over the files we are searching for. However, what if we want to do something with all the files, like creating a zip file? As you have seen so far commands will take input from both arguments and STDIN. When piping commands, we are connecting STDOUT to STDIN, but some commands like tar take inputs from arguments. To bridge this disconnect there’s the xargs command which will execute a command using STDIN as arguments. For example ls | xargs rm will delete the files in the current directory.
