# Basic
Vim maintains a set of open files, called "buffers". A vim session has a number of tabs, each of which has a number of windows(split panes). Each window show a single buffer.A given buffer may be open in multiple windows, even within the same tab.

By default, Vim opens with a single tab, which contains a single window.

## Command-line
- `:q` quit (close window)
- `:w` save ("write")
- `:wq` save and quit
- `:e{name of file}` open file for editing
- `:ls` show open buffers
- `:help {topic}` open help
    - `:help :w` opens help for the `:w` command
    - `:help w` opens help for the `w` movement
