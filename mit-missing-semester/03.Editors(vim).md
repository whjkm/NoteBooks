# Vim
## Modal editing
Vim has multiple operating modes.
- **Normal**: for moving around a file and making edits
- **Insert**: for inserting text
- **Replace**: for replacing text
- **Visual**(plain, line, or block): for selecting blocks of text
- **Command-line**: for running a command

pressing`<ESC>` to switch from any mode back to Normal mode.
From Normal mode, enter Insert mode with `i`.
Replace mode with `R`.
Visual mode with `v`.
Visual line mode with `V`,
Visual Block mode with `<C-v>`, `Ctrl-V`, `^V`.
Command-line mode with `:`.

## Basic
Vim maintains a set of open files, called "buffers". A vim session has a number of tabs, each of which has a number of windows(split panes). Each window show a single buffer.A given buffer may be open in multiple windows, even within the same tab.

By default, Vim opens with a single tab, which contains a single window.

### Command-line
- `:q` quit (close window)
- `:w` save ("write")
- `:wq` save and quit
- `:e{name of file}` open file for editing
- `:ls` show open buffers
- `:help {topic}` open help
    - `:help :w` opens help for the `:w` command
    - `:help w` opens help for the `w` movement
  
### Movement
- Basic movement: `hjkl` (left, down, up, right)
- Words: `w` (next word), `b`(begining of word), `e` (end of word)
- Lines: `0`(beginning of line), `^`(first non-blank character),`$`(end of line)
- Screen: `H`(top of screen), `M`(middle of screen),`L`(bottom of screen)
- Scroll: `Ctrl-u`(up), `Ctrl-d`(down)
- File: `gg`(beginning of file), `G`(end of file)
- Line numbers: `:{number}<CR>` or `:{number}G`(line{number})
- Misc: `%`(corresponding item)
- Find: `f{character}`,`t{character}`,`F{character}`,`T{character}`
   - find/to forward/backward{character} on the current lin
   - `,`/ `;` for navigating matches
 - Search: `/{regex}`, `n` / `N` for navigating matches

### Selection
Visual modes:
- Visual: `v`
- Visual Line: `V`
- Visual Block: `Ctrl-v`

Can use movement keys to make selection.

### Edits

- `i` enter Insert mode
- `o` / `O` insert line below / above
- `d{motion}` delete {motion}
  - e.g. `dw` is delete word, `d$` is delete to end of line, `d0` is delete to beginning of line
- `c{motion}` change {motion}
    - e.g. `cw` is change word
    - like `d{motion}` followed by `i`
- `x` delete character(equal do `dl`)
- `s` substitute character(equal do `xi`)
- Visual mode + manipulation
  - select text, `d` to delete it or `c` to change it
- `u` to undo, `<C-r>` to redo
- `y` to copy / "yank"(some other commands like `d` also copy)
- `p` to paste
- Lots more to learn: e.g. `~` flips the case of a character
  
### Counts

- `3w` move 3 words forward
- `5j` move 5 lines down
- `7dw` delete 7 words
  
### Modifiers

You can use modifiers to change the meaning of a noun. Some modifiers are `i`, which means "inner" or "inside", and `a`, which means "around".

- `ci(` change the contents inside the current pair of parentheses
- `ci[` change the contents inside the current pair of square brackets
- `da` delete a single-quoted string, including the surrounding single quotes
- `da(` or `da[` delete a whole like parenthesized group 


## Extending Vim

Since Vim 8.0, you can use the built-in package management system. Simply create the derectory `~/.vim/pack/vendor/start/`, and put plugins in there(e.g. via `git clone`)

Some plugins:
- [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim): fuzzy file finder
- [ack.vim](https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim): code search
- [nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree): file explorer
- [vim-easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion): magic motions
- [vim awesome](https://vimawesome.com/)

## Advanced Vim

### Search and replace

`:s` (substitute) command [document](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_and_replace)

- `%s/foo/bar/g`: replace foo with bar globally in file
- `%s/\[.*\](\(.*\))/\1/g`: replace named Markdown links with plain URLs
  
### Multiple windows

- `:sp` / `:vsp` to split windows: Can have multiple views of the same buffer.
- `vsp {other file}`: Can open another file in split windows.
  
### Macros

- `q{character}` to start recording a macro in register `{character}`
- `q` to stop recording
- `@{character}` replays the macro
- Macro execution stops on error
- `{number}@{character}` executes a macro `{number}` times
- Macros can be recursive
    - first clear the macro with `q{character}q`
    - record the macro, with`@{character}` to invoke the macro recursively(will be a no-op until recording is complete)
- `:reg {character}`: list macro
